This project is a fake Spotify clone(ish..)
An admin can create new songs in a page only he can reach to 
(you cant create an admin in the website only using the db to toggle the admin from false to true).
Other people can create a user and mark a favorite song that they like.
The favorite songs are marked with a golden star for not favorite and a green start if its a favorite.
There is a page with your favorite songs where you can remove songs from there too.
There is a possibility to change the password if you forgot it (but in the google Oauth 
I have only added one email to test [you can only have a specifice email when you are on
the free tier] the email is in the .env file).

Everything is on the git
