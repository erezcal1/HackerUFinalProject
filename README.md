# Fake Spotify clone

An admin can create new songs in a page only he can reach to 
(You can’t create an admin on the website only using the db to toggle the admin from false to true).
Other people can create a user and mark a favorite song that they like.
The favorite songs are marked with a golden star for not favorite and a green start if it’s a favorite.
There is a page with your favorite songs where you can remove songs from there too.
There is a possibility to change the password if you forgot it
